                    identifying information you choose to provide.
                    We collect anonymous data from every visitor of the Website to monitor traffic and fix bugs. For
                    example, we collect information like web requests, the data sent in response to such requests, the
                    Internet Protocol address, the browser type, the browser language, and a timestamp for the request.
                    We also use various technologies to collect information, and this may include sending cookies to
                    your computer. Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in your device memory that
                    helps us to improve our services and your experience, see which areas and features of our services
